# Winner takes all 

Winner takes all is a simple blockchain game for the SMLY blockchain.
The script listens for input on a given address and keeps track of 
transactions sent to it. After the pool of contestants has been filled
the script picks an address completely at random and pays the entire
pool/pot out to that address.

A sample empty poolfile is supplied in the repo but the script will 
look for it in `~/.smileycoin/poolfile`
